		Small prototype created to test the framework and have an opinion about it

	Prerequisites:

		- Node/Npm
		- Sass
		- Angularjs

			http://ionicframework.com/docs/overview/
			"Ionic currently requires AngularJS in order to work at its full potential. While you can still use the CSS portion of the framework, you'll miss out on powerful UI interactions, gestures, animations, and other things. In the future we'd like to expand beyond Angular to support other frameworks."

			* Angular 2 is getting released soon (and there's a lot of changes), Ionic is offering support: http://blog.ionic.io/angular-2-ionic/

		- Gulp (optional)
